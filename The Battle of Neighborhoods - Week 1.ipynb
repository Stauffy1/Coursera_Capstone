The goal of this project is to provide you with a map that answers these questions: In which district can you find the largest number of Indian Restaurants and any other type of restaurant? Where to eat Vietnamese, Chinese, Vegan or any other dish you would like to eat?\n\nIf you are traveling to this city for work or a short break, or if you've just moved to this city, knowing where to eat Indian, Thai or a steak can make your stay more enjoyable."
